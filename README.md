# Form Correction App 🏋 
Welcome to the weightlifting form correction app 💪 
The goal here is to create an app that can do the following:
 - Live track lifters using the phone camera and pose estimation
 - Provide real-time feedback to lifters on their form
 - After a lift, show what muscles were targeted
 - Provide insight on muscle fatigue
 - Recommend exercises, stretches, warmups, etc.
## The Tech :computer:
Currently, users can do the following:
 - Upload videos of their exercises
 - See their skeletal key points using Human Pose Estimation
 - See the amount of reps they completed within the video, without specifying what exercise
