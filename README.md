# Form Correction App 🏋 
Welcome to the weight lifting form correction app 💪 
The goal here is to create an app that can do the following:
 - Live track lifters using phone camera and pose estiamtion
 - Provide real time feedback to lifters on their form
 - After a lift, show what muscles were targeted
 - Provide insight on muscle fatigue
 - Reccomend exercises, stretches, warmups, etc.
