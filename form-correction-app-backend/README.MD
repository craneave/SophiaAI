# Welcome to my Fitness App Backend ðŸ‘‹

## Tools
This is the backend to my fitness app. Here we use Node.js and Express.js. As of now users upload videos to the backend, which are then processed by our python
scripts, and then the updated video with the key points is sent back, along with rep count and other cool things that I will be adding.
Yes, as of now, it is very very slow, and that is okay, I am not concerned. For future purposes, if I deciede to persue this idea I will either speed things up
or will just develope for ios and andriod natively, so we do not have to send videos back and forth. But like I said, for now I don't care, I only care for 
functionality. :)
## Organization
All scripts are in the src folder. There are all the python scripts, which are seperated by their functions. App.js holds all server side actions.
